# Electric Piano Project

This project aims to design and build an electric piano as part of the hardware lab course. The electric piano will produce musical notes when keys are pressed, using electronic circuits to generate and amplify sound.


## Components Required

- IC 555 Timer

- Push buttons (for piano keys)

- Resistors and capacitors

- Speaker module

- Power supply (e.g., (5-9)V battery or adapter)

- Breadboard and jumper wires
## Circuit Design

- Key Input Section: Push buttons connected to the IC 555 timers to detect key presses.

- Sound Generation: Each IC 555 timer is configured as an astable multivibrator to generate specific frequencies for musical notes.

- Speaker Output: The amplified signal is sent to a speaker to produce sound.
## Testing & Debugging

- Ensure all keys generate the correct frequency.

- Check for unwanted noise in the audio output.

- Verify power supply stability.
## Further Enhancements

- Add volume control or envelope modulation.

- Expand to a full-range keyboard.

- Integrate a sustain effect using capacitors.
## Conclusion

This electric piano project serves as a fundamental exercise in electronic circuit design and sound synthesis using IC 555 timers. It offers hands-on experience in integrating hardware components to create a functional musical instrument.
